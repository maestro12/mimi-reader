# README #

This README attempts to document how to set up this crappy project.

### What is this repository for? ###

Mimi Reader is an Android app that lets you browse 4chan on your phone.

The current open source release is 7.0.1. It is based off of the 7.0.1 release on the play store. The latest version of Mimi can always be found on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emogoth.android.phone.mimi).

*Note that the open source version has Google Play services removed as well as ads. This may change some functionality.*

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Clone
1. run `gradlew assembleFreeDebug`
